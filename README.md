My 8th mini-project! This project wrapped up everything from the bootstrap module, asking me to create a task management front-end. It required a:  

1. Home page with navbar, jumbotron with a welcome message, and cards to display key features which I did complete.  
2. A dashboard page to see individual tasks. I also did the bonus for using bootstrap badges for things like priority and category.  
3. A task creation page to add new tasks.  
4. A registration page to sign up.  
5. A log-in/authentication page that accepts username and password.  
6. For me to use bootstrap for grid and styling.  
7. It should also be responsive for smaller screen sizes.  
8. It should also have a navbar for navigation, which mine does to reach certain pages. Other pages are reached via normal use when appropriate.
